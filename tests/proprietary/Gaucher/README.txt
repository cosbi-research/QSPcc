This folder contains the MATLAB code published in [42] to simulate the GD1 QSP model. 
This code is provided as a list of function without any script entry point. 
To make this model work both in MATLAB and QSPcc you need to write an entry-point MATLAB script.
We have already done this during model development at COSBI.
Contact the Bioinformatics lab led by lombardo@cosbi.eu for further information.
