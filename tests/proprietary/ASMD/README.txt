This folder contains the MATLAB code published in [17] to simulate the ASMD QSP model. 
This model uses data stored in a MAT data file. 
This is currently supported through some additionally logic to handle MAT files in C.
We have already done this during model development at COSBI.
Contact the Bioinformatics lab led by lombardo@cosbi.eu for further information.
