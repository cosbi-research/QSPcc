This model solves a linear system involving sparse matrices at line 60.
This type of mathematical problems are solvable with libraries implementing
the linear algebra specifications as for example in openBLAS/BLIS/MKL.
We integrated and ran the hardware optimized MKL libs
during model development at COSBI.
Contact the Bioinformatics lab led by lombardo@cosbi.eu for further information.
