These are ode files for matlab that are generated by SBMLToolbox using models from the SBML Test-Suite.

The name 'casexxxxx.m' corresponds directly with the model casexxxxx in the STS.

The structure of these files is identical but there is a range of things that might be encountered such as functionDefinitions. As we identify more things that we need to account for more tests can be generated here.
