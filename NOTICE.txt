This parser was originally written by David Wingate for the mparser project,
and updated to work with ANTLR4 by Matthew Dawson for the jtet project.
Finally, it was updated to handle many more matlab constructs 
(ex. nested matrices, transpose, end, comments, mixed function definition and scripts and more) 
Also downgraded to antlr3 to take advantage of the tree rewriting feature.
